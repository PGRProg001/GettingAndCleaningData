Field             Description
Subject           Id of the subject performing the various actions.  There are 30 Subjects labelled from 1-30.
Activity          There are 6 activities namely : WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and                       LAYING.
Mean_BodyAcc_X    Is the mean of Acceleration the body in the X direction of that subject during that particular activity.                   It is measured in m/s^2 meter per (second squared).
Mean_BodyAcc_Y    Is the mean of Acceleration the body in the Y direction of that subject during that particular activity.                   It is measured in m/s^2 meter per (second squared).
Mean_BodyAcc_Z    Is the mean of Acceleration the body in the Z direction of that subject during that particular activity.                   It is measured in m/s^2 meter per (second squared).
SD_BodyAcc_X      It is the standard deviation of the acceleration in the X direction, the subject's body experiences                        during that particular activity.  It is measured in m/s^2 meter per (second squared).
SD_BodyAcc_Y      It is the standard deviation of the acceleration in the Y direction, the subject's body experiences                        during that particular activity.  It is measured in m/s^2 meter per (second squared).
SD_BodyAcc_Z      It is the standard deviation of the acceleration in the Z direction, the subject's body experiences                        during that particular activity.  It is measured in m/s^2 meter per (second squared).
