<p>There are 30 subjects in the TidyDataSet. Each of the subjects wore a Samsung Galaxy S2 mobile phone which recorded the various accelerations the subject’s body undergoes. The TidyDataSet contains a summary of the data collected. The tidyDataSet contains the the mean accelreation the subject’s body undergoes in X,Y and Z direction [Mean_BodyAcc_X, Mean_BodyAcc_Y and Mean_BodyAcc_Z ] and also the standard deviation for the mean acceleration the subject’s body ungergoes in the Z,Y and Z direction [SD_BodyAcc_X, SD_BodyAcc_Y, SD_BodyAcc_Z]. The Mean_BodyAcc_X, Mean_BodyAcc_Y and Mean_BodyAcc_Z are measured in meters per second squared. The SD_BodyAcc_X, SD_BodyAcc_Y , SD_BodyAcc_Z are measured in meters per second squared.</p>
